Hello!  I'm Matt Maxwell, PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
I work on philosophy of biology, general philosophy of science, and social epistemology.
My dissertation is on the biological concept of genetic load, what questions about load can tell us about laws in biology, and how it has been used in arguments for eugenics.

Here's a portrait of me by an undergound artist you've probably never heard of.
