Hello!  I'm Matt Maxwell, PhD Candidate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
My primary areas of reasearch are philosophy of biology and general philosophy of science.
I have also done work in social and formal epistemology.
My dissertation explores the biological concept of genetic load---a measure of fitness variation in a population---and its consequences, including: the consequences of load for the evolution, what research into load tells us about the role of laws in biology, and how load has been used in historical and current arguments for eugenics.

Here's a portrait of me by an undergound artist you've probably never heard of.
